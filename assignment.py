x = 4
print(x * x)

#  If you reassign a different value to an existing variable, the new value ovewrites the old value
x = 'hello'
print(x) 

# Doing multiple assignments at once
a, b = 1, 2
print(a)# 1
print(b)# 2
print(a + b)


# Swapping values of 2 variables in python is very simple
a, b = 1, 2
a, b = b, a

# Problem 4: What will be the output of the following code
print("Problem 4:")
x = 4
y = x + 1
x = 2
print(x,y)

# Problem 5: What will be the output of the following code
print("Problem 5:")
x, y = 2,6
x, y = y, x + 2
print(x,y)


# Problem 6: What will be the output of the following code
print("Problem 6:")
a, b = 2,3
# c, b = a, c + 1
print(a,b,) # will cause an error because 'c' is not defined


# Problem 7: How many multiplications are performed when each of the folllowing lines is executed
